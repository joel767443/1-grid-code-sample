## About the code sample

There is a landing page where one can register and login - standard laravel code. Also, I added a GitHub link. The code sample has the following.

- Migrations
- Seeders
- Services
- Scheduled commands
- Caching
- [sample site](https://1-grid.yoweli-kachala.com).


## NOTE
I have used templates for the site and admin layout. I did not code them from scratch due to time constraints

## Site instructions
- From the landing page, once can register and login
- Once in the admin section, one can register, edit and soft delete employees,
- When the address is added, there is a background process that runs every 5 minutes and updated the employees travel time from home to work
- most of the data is cached for about 10 minutes
